# My Kids 

#### This is my first mobile app last year using React Native and Expo CLI.  Created using React, React Native, React Animated, Redux, and Expo.

My Kids is a personal mobile application created to help parents and school bus drivers track kids on their way to school, including pickup from home with real-time data and location updates. It is also used by kids (students) to access their assignments and class homework.
